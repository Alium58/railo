**Glupp Shitto's amtrac nasdaq festivus scripto** (also known as "railo") is a script meant to help [Kingdom of Loathing](https://www.kingdomofloathing.com/) players efficiently collect Elf Stuff from the Train Crimbo in KOL.

To install, run the following command on an up-to-date [KolMafia](https://github.com/kolmafia/kolmafia) version:

```
git checkout loathers/railo release
```

To update, run `git update` or check the "Update installed Git projects on login" box within Mafia preferences.

## Running Railo

To run railo, run the following command in the mafia GCLI:

`railo`

You can specify the number of turns to run (use negative numbers for the number of turns remaining) with the turns argument. The following example will use 10 turns.

`railo turns=10`
